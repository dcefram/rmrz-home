      Working in fintech could get boring fast. Although DC is also a consultant for an exciting cutting edge
      consumer-facing company,
      there are times that some interesting tech just won't fit. Side projects are just a means to get our feet wet on
      exciting new tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, most of the time, it's just that we need a specific tool but the existing tools are SaaS products with
      a monthly price that is expensive for its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have our <a href="https://blog.rmrz.ph" target="_blank">blog as a subdomain</a> where we share thoughts
      that is sort of ok to share publicly. It's mostly about side projects and career tips, ie. the part of our diary
      that could be posted in a public space.
