      Working in fintech could get boring fast. Although DC is also a consultant for an exciting cutting edge
      consumer-facing company,
      there are times that some interesting tech just won't fit. Side projects are just a means to get our feet wet on
      exciting new tech.
    </p>
    <p>Actually, most of the time, it's just that we need a specific tool but the existing tools are SaaS products who's
      monthly price is expensive for its purpose.</p>
